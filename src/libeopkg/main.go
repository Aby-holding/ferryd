// Package libeopkg provides Go-native access to `.eopkg` files, allowing
// binman to read and manipulate them without having a host-side eopkg
// tool.
//
// It should also be noted that `eopkg` is implemented in Python, so calling
// out to the host-side tool just isn't acceptable for the performance we
// require.
// In time, `sol` will replace eopkg and it is very likely that we'll base
// the new `libsol` component on the C library using cgo.
