`binman` is the binary repository manager for Solus. This is a reimplementation of the current `binman` Python code, in keeping with Solus' goals of using `Go` for this kind of tooling.

`binman` aims to provide simple management of Solus repositories, with a git-like feel, and a rigid approach to caching, by pooling assets and hardlinking them into the appropriate place.


**Note**: `binman` is currently a work in progress, and isn't an **immediate** Solus tooling goal.

binman is a [Solus project](https://solus-project.com/).
